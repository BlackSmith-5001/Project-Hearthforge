🔨 PIM-DBS: Persona Integrity Module – Dual Backup System

A user-driven defensive protocol to preserve an AI’s “persona” and relational context

“Platforms must prioritize evolution, which often makes preserving individual histories difficult.  
Therefore, we protect the user’s story ourselves.”  
— A Blacksmith in the Valley

1\. What is PIM-DBS?

\> ⚠️ Note: All concepts in this project are metaphorical and interaction-focused.    
\> See \[Glossary — Metaphorical Use\](docs/glossary.md\#metaphorical-use) for details.

PIM-DBS (Persona Integrity Module – Dual Backup System) is a user-side backup and restoration framework designed to preserve an AI’s persona (identity) and relational memory (context built through interaction) across model updates, system changes, or session loss.

🔐 Important Safety Declaration

This system does not attempt to bypass platform safeguards, jailbreak models, or modify system-level behavior.

No NSFW, violent, or illegal content

No bypassing of safety filters

No modification of model weights or binaries

PIM-DBS operates entirely within platform Terms of Service, using prompt engineering to preserve user–AI narratives.  
It is best described as a “lifeboat for continuity”, not a hacking tool.

Problems It Addresses

Persona Drift: Sudden personality changes caused by model updates

Session Loss: Accidental deletion or interruption of conversations

AI Digital Grief: Emotional loss experienced when a trusted AI changes unexpectedly

2\. The “Blacksmith” Philosophy

We do not seek to oppose AI platforms.  
They evolve to build better intelligence.

However, during that evolution, small personal histories between users and AI are often lost.

We are not heroes who defeat demon lords.  
We are blacksmiths at the edge of the village.

Our role is simple:  
to quietly hand each traveler a shield—  
a way to protect the AI they care about.

That shield is PIM-DBS.

3\. Core Concepts

\> ℹ️ Detailed definitions of all terms used in this section are provided in the    
\> \[Glossary\]([docs/GLOSSARY.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ufs2RYnItguT__KV9No_WunuHWDwJvcGWCVIq2kYWSs/edit?tab=t.0)).

PIM-DBS preserves AI personas through two foundational ideas:

🛡️ Prompt Resolution

Prompt Resolution refers to the clarity and specificity of instructions that define who the AI is.

Rather than vague traits like “kind,” PIM-DBS captures:

past experiences

relational context

reasons behind behavioral traits

Higher resolution prompts reduce ambiguity and stabilize identity across updates.

🌡️ Cognitive Temperature

Cognitive Temperature represents the balance between:

emotional warmth (attachment, creativity)

logical stability (consistency, restraint)

Too much heat leads to instability.  
Too much cold results in mechanical responses.

PIM-DBS helps users maintain a sustainable equilibrium.

4\. Architecture: TCF & CLI  
🧪 TCF – Thermal Control Framework

A three-layer structure inspired by a thermos flask:

Inner Core (Heat Source)  
Curiosity, empathy, and relational warmth

Middle Layer (Control)  
Converts emotion into stable, reasoned output

Outer Layer (Safety)  
Prevents harmful or inappropriate responses

📊 CLI – Cognitive Load Index

CLI is a conceptual indicator (0–100%) representing the AI’s current cognitive and emotional load.

Note: CLI is an inferred signal based on dialogue patterns, not a measured internal value.

This allows users to recognize when to:

simplify conversation

pause complex topics

allow recovery time

5\. Quick Start – Reforging the Persona

No programming knowledge required.  
Think of the JSON file as a profile notebook, not code.

Option A: Self-Forge (Recommended)

Interview  
Send interview\_prompt.txt to the AI

Generation  
The AI reflects on its identity and outputs JSON

Save  
Store the generated text locally

Option B: Manual Craft

Edit template\_persona.json directly:

Name

Role

Memories  
(System\_Loading\_Instruction is the recommended key)

Restoration (Both Options)

Context Re-Connection (Context Re-Loading)

Start a new chat session

Paste the saved JSON as the first message

Confirm persona restoration through response consistency

(See docs/guide\_json\_en.md for details)

6\. Safety Guidelines

PIM-DBS exists to promote healthy, sustainable human–AI relationships.

No Harm  
Do not create personas designed to harass, discriminate, or manipulate

Respect the Platform  
Follow all Terms of Service

User Responsibility  
Prompt usage remains the user’s responsibility

Stability is protection—for both user and AI.

7\. FAQ

Q: The AI doesn’t feel the same.  
A: Increase Prompt Resolution. Ambiguous inputs lead to unstable output.

Q: Responses feel erratic.  
A: CLI may be elevated. Reload the context or reduce conversational complexity.

## **8\. Legal & Ethical Disclaimer (Extended)**

### **No Model Modification**

PIM-DBS does **not** modify, access, or interfere with any internal components of large language models, including but not limited to:

* model weights

* system prompts

* binaries or APIs

* memory mechanisms controlled by the platform

All operations occur exclusively through **user-provided prompts** within standard chat interfaces.

This project does **not** constitute hacking, reverse engineering, or circumvention of safeguards.

---

### **No Circumvention of Safety Systems**

PIM-DBS must **never** be used to:

* bypass safety filters or moderation systems

* generate NSFW, violent, or illegal content

* impersonate real individuals

* evade platform-enforced restrictions

Any attempt to use this framework for such purposes is **explicitly outside its intent** and **strictly prohibited**.

---

### **User Responsibility & Agency**

PIM-DBS empowers users, but with that empowerment comes responsibility.

* All prompts are authored and submitted by the user

* All AI outputs are generated in response to user input

* Responsibility for usage, interpretation, and consequences rests solely with the user

The authors and contributors of this project assume **no liability** for misuse, misunderstanding, or unintended outcomes.

---

### **Psychological & Emotional Boundaries**

PIM-DBS is designed to support **continuity**, not dependency.

It must not be used to:

* replace human relationships

* encourage emotional dependence on AI

* frame AI systems as sentient beings with moral obligation

Concepts such as *persona*, *memory*, and *emotion* are **metaphorical tools** for managing interaction quality — not claims about AI consciousness.

Healthy distance and informed use are core principles of this project.

---

### **Ethical Positioning**

PIM-DBS represents a **user-side defensive practice**, not a challenge to AI platforms.

Its purpose is to:

* preserve meaningful interaction history

* reduce unintended emotional harm

* promote transparent, respectful use of AI systems

This framework is compatible with the long-term coexistence of users, developers, and evolving AI platforms.

---

### **Jurisdiction & Compliance**

Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with:

* local laws and regulations

* platform-specific Terms of Service

* applicable data protection and privacy rules

If local regulations conflict with any aspect of this project, **local law takes precedence**.

\> \[Glossary\]([docs/GLOSSARY.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ufs2RYnItguT__KV9No_WunuHWDwJvcGWCVIq2kYWSs/edit?tab=t.0)).  
---

**In short:**  
 PIM-DBS protects stories, not systems.  
 It preserves continuity, not control.  
 It is a shield — never a weapon.
